# 🐿️ Welcome to the Archives of Eichhorney

**A digital odyssey through collective memory.**

This is not just a collection of images. It is a living archive, a curated stream of artifacts forged by the community and evaluated by the law of resonance. Here, the lines between creator and curator blur.

## 🔮 The Vision

Thousands of fleeting moments are born in the depths of the net every day. We capture them.
**Project Eichhorney** is an experiment in playful archiving. Our goal is to build a self-regulating library of meme culture—powered by creativity, humor, and a touch of madness.

We believe that collecting "digital artifacts" is more than just saving files. It is a ritual.

## 🌀 The Ritual (How to Participate)

Your journey through the archives follows an eternal cycle. Every action leaves traces and shapes the collection.

### 1. The Forge
Everything begins in the fire of the Meta Forge. Here, you create new artifacts. Whether by chance or intent—what you find here is the raw material for the future.

### 2. Release
Owning an artifact is only the beginning. To truly become part of history, you must **release** it. By doing so, you surrender it to the Archives and the judgment of the community.

### 3. Vote
Not all that glitters is gold. As a Guardian of the Archives, it is your duty to ensure quality. Your vote decides what floats to the surface and what fades into obscurity.

## 🏆 Your Ascension

In the Archives, you do not go unnoticed. The System observes. The System rewards.

### Experience & Levels
Every interaction—be it a forged work, a cast vote, or a daily visit—feeds your status. You begin as a Novice, but the path to higher planes is open to anyone who proves their persistence.

### Sigils & Badges
Special deeds are honored with permanent distinctions:
*   **Sigils:** For the first steps of your journey (the First Infusion, the First Release).
*   **Stamps:** When your artifacts move the masses and spark a trend.
*   **Fragments:** For those who return consistently and remain loyal to the Archive.
*   **Objects:** Mysterious trophies for true connoisseurs of the culture (#CroisHorney, #EichHorney).
