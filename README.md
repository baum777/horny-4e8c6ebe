# $HORNY

$HORNY is not a game. It is a system for structured participation, signaling, and alignment within a volatile market environment.

This repository contains the constitutional logic and interfaces for the $HORNY ecosystem. It serves as the framework within which participants demonstrate conviction and validate their status within the hierarchy.

## The Law of Horny

The system operates under a set of implicit laws that govern and evaluate participant behavior. These laws are not punitive but ordering. They separate signal from noise.

1.  **Presence is Mandatory**
    Passive observation is tolerated but not rewarded. Status is granted only to those who actively interact with the system.

2.  **Creativity is Currency**
    The ability to forge memes and cultural artifacts is valued as a direct contribution to network stability.

3.  **Truth through Consistency**
    Short-term attention is worthless. The system rewards those who demonstrate engagement over time ("Time Spent", "Alerts").

## Participation & Progression

Participants in the $HORNY system undergo a defined evolution. Every step is a deliberate action that integrates the participant deeper into the system's internal logic.

Ascension is not accidental but requires proof of specific attributes:

*   **Self-Discovery (Quiz):** The entry point. A diagnostic process that calibrates the participant into a class—from the hesitant "Beta Horny" to the transcendent "Meta Demon".
*   **Creation (Meme Forge):** The active contribution. Tools for generating visual propaganda that reinforce the system's narrative consistency.
*   **Vigilance (FOMO Tracker):** The discipline. Setting alerts and signals proves readiness to react to market shifts.

## Gamification as Structure

What appears superficially as "gamification" is in reality an ordering mechanism. Badges, levels, and ranks are not entertainment rewards but cryptographically verifiable signals of alignment.

*   **Classes (Ranks):** Define the participant's maturity. A "Chart Goblin" operates differently than a "Unicorn Rider".
*   **Badges:** Serve as permanent proof of performed actions (e.g., "Meme Alchemist" for creators, "Alert Sentinel" for guardians).
*   **Metrics (Horny Meter):** A quantitative indicator of the current collective intensity.

## Onboarding (Conceptual Flow)

A new participant experiences a strict sequence of understanding:

1.  **Entry & Diagnosis:** The user enters the system and is calibrated by the Quiz. Risk tolerance and market understanding determine the starting point.
2.  **Exploration:** The user navigates the artifacts and tools ("Deep Explorer").
3.  **Activation:** The user shifts from observer to actor by creating or sharing content.
4.  **Ascension:** Through repeated interaction and consistency, the user climbs the ranks and unlocks higher privileges of representation.

## Narrative Consistency

All modules of this system—from the Quiz to the Forge—serve a single narrative: The transformation of volatile emotion (market psychology) into structured order.

The system rewards not blind luck, but disciplined obsession. It is a machine that translates "Horny"—the intense desire for success and participation—into a measurable, visible, and tradeable form of status.
